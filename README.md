# ME6270 Turbulence

Instructor/Author: Yves Dubief
Mode: Lecture
Credit: 3

## Course Description
Description of turbulent flows; statistical and modeling of turbulent flows; Navier Stokes as a dynamical system; experimental and numerical approaches.

## Prerequisite(s)
* ME 2230 Fluid Mechanics.
* Knowledge of python or any other scientific programming language.

## Text
Turbulence: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers, Peter Davidson, Cambridge.

## Course Objectives
At the completion of this course, students will:
1. Have a general understanding of the physics and mathematical description of turbulent flows;
2. Understand the principle of numerical simulation and modeling of turbulence;
3. Be able to study the dynamics of coherent structures from data obtained from high-fidelity
numerical simulations;
4. Have an overall understanding of the limitations of turbulence models.

## Evaluation
1. 6 homework assignment based on problems from the book (40% of the course grade)
2. Semester-long project: Design, execution, analysis and write up of a scientific contribution
to the field of turbulence. This individual project should result in a publishable article to a scientific journal of the caliber of Physical Review Fluids or Journal of Fluid Mechanics. (60% of the course grade)
